# Feature-Sliced Design: Agent Skills

Agent skills that teach AI coding agents [Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)](https://fsd.how) v2.1 architectural methodology.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add feature-sliced/skills
```

## Available Skills

### feature-sliced-design

Apply FSD v2.1 principles when structuring frontend projects. The agent learns layer hierarchy, import rules, the decision framework for code placement, and common patterns.

**Use when:**

- Setting up or reorganizing a frontend project structure
- Deciding where to place code (pages vs. features vs. entities vs. shared)
- Placing static assets (images, icons, fonts, PDFs) in the right slice or layer
- Grouping closely related slices for navigation as the project grows
- Resolving cross-import issues or evaluating the @x pattern
- Deciding whether to create or remove an entity, or whether to skip the entities layer entirely
- Migrating from FSD v2.0 or a non-FSD codebase
- Integrating FSD with Next.js (App Router or Pages Router), Nuxt, Vite, or Astro
- Implementing auth, API request handling, or state management (Redux, TanStack Query) within FSD

**Examples:**

```text
Set up FSD project structure with Next.js App Router
```

```text
Where should I put this auth logic?
```

```text
These two entities need to import from each other. How do I fix this?
```

```text
Where should I put hero images for my landing page?
```

The agent reads only `SKILL.md` by default. Reference files are loaded on demand based on the task.

## Contributing

Run the validator before opening a pull request:

```bash
node .github/scripts/validate-skills.mjs
```

It enforces the skill package rules this repository follows, based on the guidance in [vercel-labs/agent-skills](https://github.com/vercel-labs/agent-skills) `AGENTS.md`:

- The `SKILL.md` body stays under 500 lines to keep the initial skill context lightweight. Frontmatter is excluded from the count.
- Every `references/<file>.md` path mentioned in `SKILL.md` resolves to an existing file
